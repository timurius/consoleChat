# consoleChat
I`m just learning C++ and create this chat for fun

Ok, for the first program will ask youabout your name
Just write nick which you want and press enter

Then it will ask in which mode you want to use this chat, server or client?
If you want to connect to your friend, you should write 'c' and input his IP. Before that you make sure tat your friend open his server
If you want to open your server for your frind, you must just input 's' and share your ip (it will be writen on the screen) with your friend

Now you connected to your friend!

For type the message just push 'control' on your keyboard, write a message and push enter

Have fun!
